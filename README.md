# toolbox
The toolbox that every linux web developer should have

What it does?
It can create virtual host files for apache and nginx (currently only apache works)
It can add host to /etc/hosts

Example command:
`sudo php toolbox vhost:add --with-host --with-restart local3.dev /var/www/local.dev apache`
